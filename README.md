Simplenote for Fluid.app
========================

Formerly known as [Simplenote restyled](http://lab.mightydream.com/simplenote-restyled/), this Fluid userscript now simply makes the Simplenote web interface better suited for use as a [Fluid.app](http://fluid.app) SSB.


Usage
-----

1. Create a new Fluid app.
2. Enter `https://simple-note.appspot.com` as the URL and then enter a name (such as `Simplenote`).
3. Once the app is created, go up to the _Scripts_ menu and choose _New Userscript..._.
4. Name the script whatever you want (such as `Simplenote`).
5. In the blank script that appears, copy/paste the entire contents of `simplenote.user.js`.
6. Save the script and restart the Fluid app.
